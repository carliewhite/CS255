SNHU Systems Analysis and Design

The DriverPass project was brought to us by a client who wants to create a system that allows driving students to take practice tests and schedule appointments to drive with an approved driving instructor. 

I think that I was able to capture all of the requirements that the client requested in all the diagrams that I created, as well as layed them out in the requirements document that would make sense to a development team. 

If I were to improve this project, I would have more meetings and dialogue with the client. This is so that the client can get a glimpse at what they will be getting and if there are any changes they would like to make before we start developing the system. 

I made sure that I met all the users requiremtns needs by constantly referring to the dialogue and taking thourough notes to add to the business requirements document. 

When designing software, I think that it is crucial to take all of the clients needs into consideration while also keeping up with industry standards. The current industry standard is agile and agile development values both the customers needs and iterative development, thus during the development process you must always be open to change.
